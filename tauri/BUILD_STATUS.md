# coinflip Build Status Report

## Current Status: Build In Progress

The `npm run build` command has been initiated. This is the first build, which typically takes **5-10 minutes** as it compiles all Rust dependencies from scratch.

## What's Happening

The build process is:
1. ‚úÖ Installing Node.js dependencies (completed)
2. üîÑ Compiling Rust dependencies (in progress)
3. ‚è≥ Building the Tauri application
4. ‚è≥ Creating Windows installers (NSIS and MSI)

## Expected Build Output

Once the build completes successfully, you should find installers at:

### Windows Installers
```
coinflip/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nsis/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coinflip_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe    (NSIS Installer)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ msi/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coinflip_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi    (MSI Installer)
```

## How to Check Build Status

### Option 1: Check for Target Directory
```bash
cd coinflip/src-tauri
dir target
```

If the `target` directory exists, the build has started. If `target/release/bundle` exists, the build is near completion.

### Option 2: Check Terminal Output
Look at the terminal where you ran `npm run build`. You should see:
- Cargo downloading and compiling crates
- "Compiling" messages for various dependencies
- "Finished" message when compilation is done
- "Bundling" messages when creating installers

### Option 3: Wait for Completion Message
The build will display a success message when complete, showing the paths to the created installers.

## What to Do After Build Completes

### 1. Verify Build Output
Check that both installers were created:
```bash
cd coinflip/src-tauri/target/release/bundle
dir nsis
dir msi
```

### 2. Test NSIS Installer
```bash
# Run the NSIS installer
.\nsis\coinflip_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe
```

Expected behavior:
- Installer window opens
- Choose installation location (default: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\coinflip\)
- Installation completes
- Start Menu shortcut created
- Desktop shortcut option available

### 3. Test the Installed Application
After installation:
- Launch from Start Menu or Desktop shortcut
- Test coin flip functionality
- Test heads/tails selection
- Verify statistics tracking
- Test dark mode toggle
- Test sound effects
- Close and reopen to verify localStorage persistence

### 4. Test MSI Installer
```bash
# Run the MSI installer (requires admin rights)
.\msi\coinflip_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi
```

Expected behavior:
- Windows Installer dialog opens
- Choose installation location (default: C:\Program Files\coinflip\)
- Installation completes
- Start Menu shortcut created

### 5. Copy Installers to Safe Location
Once verified, copy the installers to a distribution folder:
```bash
# Create a distribution folder on Desktop
mkdir C:\Users\Dan Neiderhiser\Desktop\coinflip-Installers

# Copy installers
copy src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\coinflip_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe C:\Users\Dan Neiderhiser\Desktop\coinflip-Installers\
copy src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\coinflip_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi C:\Users\Dan Neiderhiser\Desktop\coinflip-Installers\
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails

**Error: Missing WebView2**
```bash
# Download and install WebView2 Runtime
# https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/
```

**Error: Rust compilation errors**
```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo clean
cd ..
npm run build
```

**Error: Icon-related errors**
```bash
# Verify all icon files exist
dir src-tauri\icons
```

### If Build Takes Too Long

First builds can take 10-15 minutes on slower systems. This is normal. Subsequent builds will be much faster (1-2 minutes).

## Testing Checklist

Once the application is installed, test these features:

- [ ] Application launches successfully
- [ ] Window size is correct (600x700)
- [ ] Coin flip animation works smoothly
- [ ] Heads/Tails radio buttons work
- [ ] Statistics update correctly
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works
- [ ] Sound plays on coin flip
- [ ] Preferences persist after closing and reopening
- [ ] No console errors (right-click ‚Üí Inspect Element)
- [ ] Application uninstalls cleanly

## Cross-Platform Builds

### macOS Build (requires macOS machine)
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates: DMG and .app in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

### Linux Build (requires Linux machine)
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates: DEB and RPM in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

## Build Time Estimates

| Build Type | First Build | Subsequent Builds |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Windows | 5-10 minutes | 1-2 minutes |
| macOS | 5-10 minutes | 1-2 minutes |
| Linux | 5-10 minutes | 1-2 minutes |

## Next Steps

1. ‚è≥ Wait for current build to complete
2. ‚úÖ Verify installers were created
3. ‚úÖ Test NSIS installer
4. ‚úÖ Test MSI installer
5. ‚úÖ Test installed application
6. ‚úÖ Copy installers to safe location
7. ‚úÖ Distribute to users
